				There are over 55 million people worldwide living with dementia in 2020. Memory loss and disorientation are some of the symptoms of this syndrome. So, this is where our company steps in. Our device will allow people who have memory loss, caused by dementia, to find their lost belongings. We believe this will be a chance for these people to live a calmer and happier standard of living. For those who want to have a better quality of life, we “stick with you”.
